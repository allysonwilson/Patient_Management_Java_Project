# Patient_Management_Java_Project

I've adapted the Fantasy Zoo Manager project brief to a hospital's patient bed management system. The Hospital
Class equates to a Zoo with the ability to add Wards (enclosures). Patients can be admitted and discharged. They are also able
to increase their health by an eat method. This satisfies the requirements of the MVP.  I have also completed the extension of
excluding some patients from admission according to gender. (Example being, a male couldn't be admitted to the maternity 
ward.) If time had allowed I would have liked to have utilized the Hospital HashMap to be able to analyze bed availability,
introduce a method that allowed patients to randomly leave the ward for a smoke break, and a method that patients could gain 
enough health to become eligible for discharge.



## Fantasy Zoo Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings.

MVP

The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

Project Extensions

Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other.
Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left.
View the total income for the zoo.
Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures
